# Yockers X-Ray for Minecraft Bedrock

My version of the Xray for mcpe works with the block shapes in the blockshapes part. There you will find all possible blockshapes of bedrock version 1.14! In my pack I used the block shapes 'end-rod' and 'turtle_egg' so I can see where blocks are. **Warning** its realy bad for your fps to use this shape!

## Usage

[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/0uxu5saqwaptb7x/X-Ray.mcpack/file) the pack on the "Download" button.

## How to edit the Pack

Download these files as ".zip" file and rename them to a ".mcpack" renaming [tutorial](https://youtu.be/eaeVxQUnWoY). On Compuers you can find the pack under the following file path:

*note: replace the XXX with the username of your windows account*
```
C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\resource_packs
```
There is a folder named "Yockers x ray" or something like that. You have to open this folder and edit the blockshapes in the blocks.json file. If you want to have for example transparent stone, sandstone, gravel, dirt etc blocks you have to enter for example invisible at the blockshape field in this file.

**Green:** is the name of the texture you want to change

**Blue:** [replace options](#Blockshapes)
